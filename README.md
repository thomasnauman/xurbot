# tomariscool's Xûr Bot

This is a Discord Bot that displays vendor data for Xûr, Agent of the Nine in Destiny 2.
The only command so far is !xur, but I might add more later.
I have a command set up that will make Xurbot automatically poll the Bungie API at 12 PM CST on Fridays. I am in the process of debugging this feature, but once it is functional, I will run this bot on a server so it is accessible 24/7.

For any questions, contact me at tomariscool#0289 on Discord

NOTE: 11/11/2023
This project has been deprecated. I have completely rewritten this bot and it now works much more efficiently. The new bot can be found on my GitHub page under the name "xur".
